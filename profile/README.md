## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

This is an online open educational resources repository that is part of the [SOLES Open Educational Resources group](https://github.com/usyd-soles-edu).
Resources will be available for the following units:

- [ENVX1002: Introduction to Statistical Methods](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX1002) - _partially implemented, should complete in 2024_
- [ENVX2001: Applied Statistical Methods](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX2001) - _partially implemented, full migration planned for 2025_
- [ENVX3002: Statistics in the Natural Sciences](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX3002) - _scheduled for 2025_

## Handbooks

Handbooks (also called manuals) are supplementary course material for a Unit of Study. Not all units deploy handbooks, but we plan to do so for ENVX units. Note that the books are still in development (2024).

- ENVX1002 Handbook | [*Source*](https://github.com/ENVX-resources/ENVX1002-manual)
- ENVX2001 Handbook - *will be released in 2025*

These links are for quick access to the resource outputs (documents). They are updated as the resources are developed. If you are interested in the source code, scroll down to the "Repositories" section on this page.s
