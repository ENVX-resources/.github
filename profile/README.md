## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

This is an online open educational resources repository that is part of the [SOLES Open Educational Resources group](https://github.com/usyd-soles-edu).

Resources will be available for the following units:

- [ENVX1002: Introduction to Statistical Methods](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX1002) 
- [ENVX2001: Applied Statistical Methods](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX2001) 
- [ENVX3002: Statistics in the Natural Sciences](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX3002) - scheduled for 2025

The following are currently in development:

- Lecture slides for ENVX1002 and ENVX2001
- Handbook for ENVX1002
- Lab documents for ENVX1002 and ENVX2001

## Handbooks

Handbooks (also called manuals) are supplementary course material for a Unit of Study. Not all units deploy handbooks, but we plan to do so for ENVX units. Note that the books are still in development (2024).

## Lectures
Lectures are still being actively converted (from MS Powerpoint). 

> [!NOTE]
> If you are currently enrolled in the course(s) below and cannot find a lecture slide for the week,  **check Canvas as the Unit of Study sites will always host the latest learning resources for download.**
